# Notepad++ Macro Creator

A quick way to convert text to macro.

If I have a block of code and I want to use it as a template, I'd turn it into a macro. To do that, I'd need to type the code all over again. No, thanks. That's a huge was of time and effort. I can just convert the code into macro and add it to `shortcuts.xml` file.
